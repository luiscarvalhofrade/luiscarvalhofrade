# Hi â€” I'm Luis ðŸ‘‹
Coming from an economics background, I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, but I discovered my true passion in technology. After a period of exploration, I shifted my focus from finance to building solutions through software, data, and product development.
With a diverse background spanning business analysis, finance, programming, data science, and product management, I am committed to deepening my expertise and creating meaningful impact by turning ideas and data into technology that solves real problems.
